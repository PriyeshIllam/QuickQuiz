# Overview
QuickQuiz is a small, accessible multiple-choice quiz app built with React + TypeScript. The goal is to demonstrate how well-written tests can specify behavior clearly enough that another developer could implement the app from scratch using only this README and the tests.

## Scope of assessment: 
Only this README and the tests inside tests/ are provided for submission, per the assignment instructions.

## User Stories
As a user, I can see a Landing screen with a description and a “Start Quiz” button.

As a user, I can toggle between light/dark themes at any time.

As a user, when I start the quiz, I see one Question card at a time with mutually exclusive answer options and a disabled Submit button until I pick an option.

As a user, when I submit an answer, my ScoreBoard updates (score, answered/total) and I automatically move to the next question.

As a user, after the final question, I see a Result screen with my final score and a Play Again button.

As a user, when I click Play Again, the app resets to the Landing screen with all state cleared and the theme preserved.

## Features & Behavior (Acceptance Criteria)
### LandingScreen

![Landing page](./screenshots/image.png)

- Renders an h2 heading “Welcome to QuickQuiz”

- Renders a description paragraph

- Renders a button with aria-label="start-quiz" that calls onStart when clicked

### ThemeToggle

- A button with aria-label="toggle-theme"

- Label text reflects current theme:

  - theme="light" → shows text “Switch to dark”
  ![theme=light](./screenshots/image-1.png)

  - theme="dark" → shows text “Switch to light”
  ![theme=dark](./screenshots/image-2.png)

- Clicking the button triggers onToggle and updates the document root attribute data-theme to "light" or "dark"

- Theme persists when navigating between screens

### QuestionCard
![Question card](./screenshots/image-3.png)

- Displays the question in an h2

- Renders N radio inputs (one per option) with:

  - name="q-{question.id}"

  - aria-label="answer-{index}"

### Submit button:


- type="submit", aria-label="submit-answer"

- Disabled until a radio option is selected
![submit button-disabled](./screenshots/image-9.png)

- On submit, calls onSubmit(selectedIndex)
![Submit button](./screenshots/image-8.png)

- When the question prop changes, the current selection resets to none

### ScoreBoard
![Score board](./screenshots/image-7.png)

- Renders a live region (role="status" with aria-live="polite")

- Displays Score: {score} and Answered: {answered}/{total}

### ResultScreen
![Result screen](./screenshots/image-6.png)

- Shows h2 heading “Quiz complete!”

- Shows final score in the format Your score: {score} / {total}

- “Play Again” button (aria-label="play-again") calls onPlayAgain

### Quiz Flow

- Starting the quiz transitions from Landing → Question 1

- Submitting each answer advances to the next question, updating ScoreBoard

- After the last question, navigate to ResultScreen

- Clicking Play Again returns to LandingScreen, resets quiz state, and preserves theme


## What the tests cover
### Integration Tests — App.integration.test.tsx

- Uses getByRole and simulates click to transition screens

2. Answers a question and updates scoreboard

- Verifies stateful updates to role="status" (Answered count & Score)

3. Completes quiz and shows result screen

- Loops through submitting answers until result screen visible

4. Play again resets quiz

- Ensures full reset to Landing with heading and Start button

5. Toggles theme and persists across quiz
